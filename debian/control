Description: Text-mode WWW Browser
 Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for
 users running cursor-addressable, character-cell display
 devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on
 PCs or Macs, or any other "curses-oriented" display). It
 will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents
 containing links to files residing on the local system, as
 well as files residing on remote systems running Gopher,
 HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.
